The raw data can be found from the folder Fig2_II.OBN (go one folder up).

The data processing steps are clearly described in Yang and Song (2020, JGR, https://doi. org/10.1029/2019JB018652), a reference of YSR21: "removing the mean and trend, integrating from velo- city to displacement records, convolving with the World‐Wide Standardized Seismograph Network short‐period response, and further bandpass filtering between 0.6 and 3.0 Hz".

Below are the corresponding SAC commands to get the processed waveform in YSR21 for doublet D2:

SAC> r ../Fig2_II.OBN/seismograms/Event_1993_11_05_07_02_06/II.OBN.00.BHZ.sac 
SAC> rmean; rtrend; int; transfer to wwsp; bp c 0.6 3; interpolate delta 0.001
SAC> w YSR21.D2.1993.II.OBN.00.BHZ.sac

SAC> r ../Fig2_II.OBN/seismograms/Event_2004_05_09_22_25_31/II.OBN.00.BHZ.sac 
SAC> rmean; rtrend; int; transfer to wwsp; bp c 0.6 3; interpolate delta 0.001
SAC> w YSR21.D2.2004.II.OBN.00.BHZ.sac 

Note the processing steps are different from those in the comment by Zhang and Wen.

(1) Instrument response is not yet removed for dt computation (“we adopted the dt measurements from the interpolated (to 1000 sps) BHZ waveform data in Yang and Song (2020b)”).

(2) A correction for instrument upgrade is conducted separately and exemplified in the Fig. 2 of YSR21, and the values are documented in the 6th column of Table S2 of YSR21.

(3) We also notice Zhang and Wen likely used a two-pass filter, but we used one-pass filter here.

It is therefore not surprising that Zhang and Wen were not able to reproduce our dt measurements and waveforms.
