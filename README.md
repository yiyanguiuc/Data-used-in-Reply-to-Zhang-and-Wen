# Data-used-in-Reply-to-Zhang-and-Wen
This repository includes the waveform data and scripts for the figures of Yang et al. (2024), which is a reply to the comment by Xin Zhang and Lianxing Wen.

We welcome interested readers to examine and reproduce the processed waveforms and the relative time shift (dt) measurements in each folder by following the steps in README. 

Caution! Waveform processing steps in Zhang and Wen (2024) are different from ours. Please go to folder FigA1_D2_II.OBN to check the difference, and compare our Fig. A1 with their Fig. A3a. The issue of "not reproducible" raised by them mainly stems from inconsistent procedures compared to ours.
